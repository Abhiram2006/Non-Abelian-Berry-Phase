# Structure of this repository

This repository is an introduction to Ising models, in specific Transverse Field Ising models. It also introduces the concept of a geometrical/topological phase i.e the Berry panchatantram phase. We investigate how to implement Berry Phase in a Ising model, which inherently has a SU(2) degenerate subspace which makes the eigenbasis ambiguous.

  ## Classical Ising Model
 
We will investigate the basic theory of the Classical Ising model, then simulate the 2D Ising Model using a naive Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and then an optimised Swendsen Wang Cluster Algorithm. (All of these simulations have been studied a lot of times in previous works, I have merely included them for educational purposes and is not original research.) We investigate the phase transition behaviour of the Classical Ising Model before moving to the Transerse field Ising Model.
