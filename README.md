# Structure of this repository

This repository is an introduction to Ising models, in specific Transverse Field Ising models. It also introduces the concept of a geometrical/topological phase i.e the Berry panchatantram phase. We investigate how to implement Berry Phase in a Ising model, which inherently has a SU(2) degenerate subspace which makes the eigenbasis ambiguous.

  ## Classical Ising Model
 
We will investigate the basic theory of the Classical Ising model and ferromagnetism. We investigate the meaning of a phase transition and the Hamiltonian of the Classical Ising model.

Then we investigate a classical Ising chain and show how inherently a phase transition cannot exist in 1 dimension. However, as we investigate the 2D Ising model, we reproduce the standard result that there can exist a phase transition in 2 dimensions using the Peirlesis argument. We then simulate the 2D Ising Model using a naive Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and then an optimised Swendsen Wang Cluster Algorithm. We were able to prove the existence of phase transition in 2 dimensions as expected.
  
(All of these Classical Ising model simulations, in specific, have been studied a lot of times in previous works. I have merely included them for educational purposes and is not original research).
