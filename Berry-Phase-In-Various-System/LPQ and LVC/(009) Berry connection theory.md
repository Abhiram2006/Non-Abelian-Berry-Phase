<h1> Define the Berry connection in (r_1,r_2) parameter space </h1>

The Berry connection is a vector field that tells us how much the eigenvectors change with respect to a small perturbation in  𝑟1  and  𝑟2  at each point. It is defined as follows:









We can see that this connection is a vector-valued function for each separate eigenstate  ||𝜓𝑖⟩  in our system, which tells how much a little change in our parameters induces a little change in the eigenvector. If we think about this carefully, we can see that summing up all the little changes in our eigenvector on a path through  (𝑟1,𝑟2)  space gives the total change in the eigenvector:


If our deformation of the Hamiltonian is cyclic, our path  𝐑:{(𝑟1(𝑡),𝑟2(𝑡)|𝑡 ∈ [0,1)}  will share starting and ending points. This allows us to define the Berry phase for closed cyclic paths in parameter space:


It has been shown that for paths that encircle a conical intersection in parameter space, the Berry phase can be nontrivial (𝛾_𝑖 ≠ 0). Let's build the Berry connection for the LPQ Hamiltonian defined above, integrate around the central conical intersection, and see if the overlap between the initial and final states is 1 or -1.
