Na√Øve Un-optimized Metropolis Monte Carlo Simulation of Classical 2D Ising Model. The physical parameters of the system were plotted per unit spin. As can be seen in the figure, the phase transition is abrupt and the points near criticality were distributed randomly. The phase transition behavior is not predicted properly.
