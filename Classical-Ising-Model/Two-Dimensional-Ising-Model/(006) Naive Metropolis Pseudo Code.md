Then I made a function which flips the spins if certain conditions are obeyed. Firstly I have
to analyse the interaction of Spin at lattice site n,m with its 4 neighbours


I also defined the configuration function:

Flip a random spin, if the change in energy (∆E) is negative then flip it. Else flip it with a
probability of exp(−∆E·β).
