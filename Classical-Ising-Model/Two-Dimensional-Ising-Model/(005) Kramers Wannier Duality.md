We computed the partition function perturbatively in two extreme regimes of low temperature
and high temperature. The physics in the two cases is very different. At low temperatures,
the partition function is dominated by the lowest energy states; at high temperatures it is
dominated by maximally disordered states. Yet comparing the partition functions at low
temperature (7) and high temperature (22) reveals an extraordinary fact: the expansions are
the same!
