We computed the partition function perturbatively in two extreme regimes of low temperature and high temperature. The physics in the two cases is very different. At low temperatures, the partition function is dominated by the lowest energy states; at high temperatures it is dominated by maximally disordered states. Yet comparing the partition functions at low
temperature and high temperature reveals an extraordinary fact: the expansions are the same (in theory)!

In other words:

Of course, we’ve only checked the agreement to the first few orders in perturbation theory.
But we can prove that this miracle continues to all orders and above equation is known as the Kramers-Wannier Duality.
  
  
We can express the statement of the duality more clearly. The Ising model at temperature β is related to the same model at temperature β˜, defined as:

Simplifying this further gives us

This is a hot/cold duality. When βJ is large, β˜ is small. Kramers-Wannier duality is the
statement that, when B = 0, the partition functions of the Ising model at two temperatures
are related by:
