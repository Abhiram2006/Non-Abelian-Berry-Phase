For low temperatures the partition function can be approximated by the sum over the first few lowest energy states, now we need to list these states.
The ground state is trivial where all the spins are up/down for example:

Both these ground states have an energy E = E0 = −2NJ
We can get the first excited by flipping one spin:

Each spin has 4 neighbours so the cost of flipping is 4 ∗ (J − (−J))) = 8J =⇒ E1 = E0 + 8J.
Of course there are N different spins that can flip hence the 1st excited state has a degeneracy
of N.
 
We can represent these excited states in a much more useful way, where we draw only the broken (denoted by red lines) which connect two spins of opposite   orientations. We represent the flipped spins by red dots and unflipped spins by blue dots. The energy of the state can be determined just by the number of red lines.
  
The first excited state can be represented by:

The next state has six broken bonds:
