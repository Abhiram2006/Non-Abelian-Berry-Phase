For low temperatures the partition function can be approximated by the sum over the first few lowest energy states, now we need to list these states.
The ground state is trivial where all the spins are up/down for example:

Both these ground states have an energy E = E0 = −2NJ
We can get the first excited by flipping one spin:

Each spin has 4 negihbours so the cost of flipping is 4 ∗ (J − (−J))) = 8J =⇒ E1 = E0 + 8J.
Of course there are N different spins that can flip hence the 1st excited state has a degeneracy
of N.
