Let us say, we have a 2D lattice of spins in their ground state. We can flip a bunch of spins together, making a droplet of anti-aligned spins. The enthalpy cost to make such a droplet would be 2JL, it scales with the perimeter as only the spins at the edge are mis-aligned with the lattice. How many ways/degeneracies are present for such a droplet? One can travel in 4 directions from a point on a lattice, but since we dont want the path to self intersect, the number of ways to make a closed path of length L would be:
