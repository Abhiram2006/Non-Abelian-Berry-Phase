Classical phase transitions occur in systems in which a statistical ensemble of particles interact with one another, resulting in variations in collective behavior as the temperature is varied.

One such system is the Ising model of ferromagnetism, where there are spins on a lattice that interact with each other (Internal energy (kinda)) and they also interact with an external magnetic field (External energy). The Ising model, named after Ernst Ising and William Lenz at its core is a statistical mathematical model of ferromagnetism. The "spins" are essentially a type of magnetic dipole moment, which in the Classical model we assume to be +1/-1. Spins that are aligned, are at a lower energy, spins try to align each with other. At absolute 0 temperature and no non-uniform external magnetic field, we would expect the spins to be perfectly aligned with +1 magneitization. However, just another statistical system, the vanderwaal gas, as the temperature is increased past the critical temperature a phase transition from +1 magnetisation to 0 magnetisation ensues. However, heat is not the only way a phase transition might ensue. A phase transition is defined much more generally. A change in a global parameter space that corresponds to a significant change in the system is a phase transition. It is intended to be open-ended.


In a 1D Ising chain, Ernst Ising was able to prove that there cannot exist a phase transition. However, based on this he incorrectly concluded that the Ising model in general does not exhibit phase transitions. 


Using the Peirlesis Argument, we prove why there can exist a phase transition in 2 dimensions. Then when discuss the partition function at low and high temperatures and the Krammer Wannier Duality linking both the cases. 

We then used a naive Metropolis Hasting Algorithm and a optimised cluster Swedsen Wang Algorithm to verify and investigate phase transition behaviour.
