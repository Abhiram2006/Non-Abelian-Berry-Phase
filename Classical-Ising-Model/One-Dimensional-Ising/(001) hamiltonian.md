The Hamiltonian of the Ising model has two components. The internal component, interaction betweeen spins and the external component, interaction of spin with an external magnetic field. 


Internal component:

{σ} represents the spin configuration, J represents the interaction strength, σ_i represents the spin at lattice site i, σ_j represents the spin at lattice site j. To avoid double-counting, we sum over edges not lattices.
