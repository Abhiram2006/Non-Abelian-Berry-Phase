The Hamiltonian of the Ising model has two components. The internal component, interaction betweeen spins and the external component, interaction of spin with an external magnetic field. 


Internal component:

{σ} represents the spin configuration, J represents the interaction strength, σ_i represents the spin at lattice site i, σ_j represents the spin at lattice site j. To avoid double-counting, we sum over edges not lattices.

Also note a very important disctinction, this ising model is discontinuous. In the sense that its in a continuous straight line and the enda are point of discontinuity. However a continuous Ising model may be made where the chain wraps around and the ends start interacting with each other.
