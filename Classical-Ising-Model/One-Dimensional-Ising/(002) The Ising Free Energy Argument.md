How do we decide if a phase transition is favourable or not? A process's spontaneity is decided by its free energy. We can flip a spin a see whether the free energy is negative. If it is negative that means the process is favourable.

The change in free energy of a process has 3 components, its temperature, the change in enthalpy of the process and the change in randomness/degeneracies/entropy of the system. Note that I specifically said change in free energy, this is because free energy is a state function, and only change of free energy is defined not free energy at a particular phase. Exactly like potential.

ΔH represents the enthalpy, or the difference between the final and initial Hamiltonian of the process.

T represents the temperature (in K) at which the process occurs.

ΔS represents the change in entropy of the process, i.e change in randomness. However it can be thought of interms of probability/degeneracies.

Where Ω is the total possible microstates of the system.
