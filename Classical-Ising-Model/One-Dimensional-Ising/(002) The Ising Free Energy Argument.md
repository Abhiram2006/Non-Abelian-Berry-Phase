How do we decide if a phase transition is favourable or not? A process's spontaneity is decided by its free energy. We can flip a spin a see whether the free energy is negative. If it is negative that means the process is favourable.

The change in free energy of a process has 3 components, its temperature, the change in enthalpy of the process and the change in randomness/degeneracies/entropy of the system. Note that I specifically said change in free energy, this is because free energy is a state function, and only change of free energy is defined not free energy at a particular phase. Exactly like potential.

Î”H represents the enthalpy, or the difference between the final and initial Hamiltonian.
