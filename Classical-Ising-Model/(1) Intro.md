Classical phase transitions occur in systems in which a statistical ensemble of particles interact with one another, resulting in variations in collective behavior as the temperature is varied.

One such system is the Ising model of ferromagnetism, where there are spins on a lattice that interact with each other (Internal energy (kinda)) and they also interact with an external magnetic field (External energy). The Ising model, named after Ernst Ising and William Lenz at its core is a statistical mathematical model of ferromagnetism. The "spins" are essentially a type of magnetic dipole moment, which in the Classical model we assume to be +1/-1. Spins that are aligned, are at a lower energy, spins try to align each with other. At absolute 0 temperature and no non-uniform external magnetic field, we would expect the spins to be perfectly aligned with +1 magneitization. However, just another statistical system, the vanderwaal gas, as the temperature is increased past the critical temperature a phase transition from +1 magnetisation to 0 magnetisation ensues. However, heat is not the only way a phase transition might ensue. A phase transition is defined much mmore geneerally 







In particular, the phase transition from low to high magnetization exhibited by the 2D Ising model has been used as the prototypical example of how phase transitions emerge classically. Real physical systems, however, must be treated quantum mechanically, and the additional degrees of freedom available in quantum mechanics can drastically alter the phase transition behavior of such systems. Here we study the phase transition behavior of the quantum mechanical Transverse-field Ising Model using various Monte Carlo methods. A comparison of our results to classical Ising model simulations will illuminate the ways in which quantum mechanics deviates from classical mechanics.
