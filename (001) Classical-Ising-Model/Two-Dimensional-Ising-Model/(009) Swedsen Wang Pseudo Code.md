A. A site x with spin σx is selected at random and added to an empty cluster
B. For each neighbour y of x such that σy = σx we add y to the cluster stack with
probability p(x, y) = 1exp(2βJxy) else move onto next neighbour
C. After all neighbours are exhausted select next site in the cluster stack and repeat the
previous step until the cluster stack is exhausted
D. Once the cluster is fully specified flip the spins of all sites in the cluster and begin
again


The 2 dimensional Ising model converges to the thermodynamic limit for a relatively low value of size of grid.
