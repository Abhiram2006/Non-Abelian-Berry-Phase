Optimized Cluster Swendsen Wang Simulation of Classical 2D Ising Model. The physical parameters of the system were plotted per unit spin. The phase transition behavior is smooth and was predicted properly.

  
The Swendsen Wang Cluster Simulation simulated phase transition behavior much better than the Naive Algorithm as expected. The phase transition occurred at close to the theoretical value of 2.3K, implying our theoretical predictions agree with simulations.
